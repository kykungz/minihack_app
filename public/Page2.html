                I add 1 more attribute name hit initially equals to 0. Changes code in updateGameArea function when there is a collision instead of making the game stop I increase the hit variable by 1. And add if statement to check whether the hit variable is >= 3.
                If it is, do like the original code and reset the hit, if not, clear the obstacles by myObstacles = [];
